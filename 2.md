# Step 2: Generate and use a new service ticket

## Objectives

* Introduce RBAC and service tickets.
* Learn how to get a service ticket using POST /ticket REST API call.
* Learn how to use the service ticket for subsequent requests.

## What is RBAC and why do you need a service ticket?

The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) mechanism on the Cisco APIC-EM assigns a security role to every user account. That role determines which Cisco APIC-EM resources and operations are available for that user account.

The Cisco APIC-EM controller defines the following roles and privileges:

* **Administrator (ROLE_ADMIN)** provides the user with full administrative privileges to all Cisco APIC-EM resources, including the ability to add or remove users and accounts.
* **Policy Administrator (ROLE_POLICY_ADMIN)** enables the user to create and manage policies.
* **Observer (ROLE_OBSERVER)** provides the user with primarily read-only privileges to the Cisco APIC-EM.
* **Installer (ROLE_INSTALLER)** enables the user to use the Cisco Plug and Play Mobile App to remotely access the APIC-EM controller in order to deploy devices and view device status. An installer cannot directly access the Cisco APIC-EM GUI.

A security token known as a service ticket encapsulates user identity and role information as a single value.

RBAC-governed APIs use the service ticket to make access-control decisions. Therefore, to start, you send the Cisco APIC-EM a `POST /ticket` request with your username and password. If the APIC-EM controller authenticates your request, it returns a service ticket that encapsulates the role associated with the authenticated user account.

After you get the service ticket, you include it in all of the subsequent calls you send to the controller. When the controller receives those calls, it checks the service ticket before performing the action requested by the call.

## Generate a service ticket

So, to get a service ticket:

1. Locate the `lab1-1-post-ticket.py` script among the files you synced earlier. For example: `apicem-apis-with-python-sample-codes\basic-labs\lab1-1-post-ticket.py`
2. If you’re using an alternate APIC-EM instead of the default one, edit the `username` and `password` parameter values and then save the edited document. Make sure to comment out the correct lines:
#### To edit the code with a Mac use the Finder to open the text file or use the `open` command followed by the file name from the terminal.
#### To edit the code with a PC use Explorer to open the text file or use the `notepad` command followed by the file name from the CLI.
3. Use a python command to run the script. For example:
    * On Linux or macOS: `python3 lab1-1-post-ticket.py`
    * On Windows: `py -3 lab1-1-post-ticket.py or python lab1-1-post-ticket.py`

#### Code listing: `lab1-1-post-ticket.py`

Here’s the script code, with comments:

import requests   # Use Python "requests" module to do HTTP GET query
import json       # Import JSON encoder and decode module

requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings() # Disable warnings

# APIC-EM IP, modify these parameters if you are using your APIC-EM
apicem_ip = "sandboxapicem.cisco.com"
username = "devnetuser"
password = "Cisco123!"
version = "v1"

# JSONhttps://sandboxapicem.cisco.com/ input
r_json = {
    "username": username,
    "password": password
}

# POST ticket API URL
post_url = "https://"+apicem_ip+"/api/"+version+"/ticket"

# All APIC-EM REST API request and response content type is JSON.
headers = {'content-type': 'application/json'}

# Make request and get response - "resp" is the response of this request
resp = requests.post(post_url, json.dumps(r_json), headers=headers,verify=False)
print ("Request Status: ",resp.status_code)

# Get the json-encoded content from response
response_json = resp.json()
print ("\nRaw response from POST ticket request:\n",resp.text)
# Not that easy to read the raw response, so try the formatted print out

# Pretty print the raw response
print ("\nPretty print response:\n",json.dumps(response_json,indent=4))

</code></pre>

</details>


Here’s the script output:

```json
('Request Status: ', 200)
('\nRaw response from POST ticket request:\n', u'{"response":{"serviceTicket":"ST-16302-cKDpKVcv0fek6nx5YeaT-cas","idleTimeout":1800,"sessionTimeout":21600},"version":"1.0"}')
('\nPretty print response:\n', '{\n    "version": "1.0", \n    "response": {\n        "idleTimeout": 1800, \n        "sessionTimeout": 21600, \n        "serviceTicket": "ST-16302-cKDpKVcv0fek6nx5YeaT-cas"\n    }\n}')
```

The service ticket you need is the value of `serviceTicket` attribute. For example:
`"serviceTicket": "ST-16302-cKDpKVcv0fek6nx5YeaT-cas"`


```
response_json = resp.json()
print ("ticket: ",response_json["response"]["serviceTicket"])
```

The output from the preceding code looks similar to this:

`ticket:  ST-16302-cKDpKVcv0fek6nx5YeaT-cas`

## Put the service ticket and other reusable items in a file

Many of your scripts reuse the service ticket and other values such as the `host url`, `username`, and `password`. These scripts also import the same modules, such as `requests` and `json`. Therefore, it makes sense to configure/define/import all these items in one place: the `apicem.py` file.

Because your scripts generate new service tickets frequently, you should also add a `Thisget_X_auth_token()` function to the `apicem.py` file.

To access the items in the `apicem.py` file, start every script in this lab with the following import statement:

```python
from apicem import *
```

*This import statement enables you to access all of the resources in apicem.py*

### Using the service ticket

Almost every API call you send to Cisco APIC-EM REST must provide a service ticket; it doesn't matter whether the request is a `POST`, `GET`, `PUT` or `DELETE`. To provide the service ticket with your call, use an `X-Auth-Token` header. The header is a name-value pair that includes the value of your service ticket:

```json
{"X-Auth-Token": "service_ticket_value" }
```

Replace `service_ticket_value` with the value of your service ticket. You don't have to get a new service ticket every time you make a request. However, the service ticket value must be valid and unexpired. In this lab, for simplicity, you start by getting a new service ticket each time you make a call to the API. Later, you'll see how to get and reuse a service ticket.

The following `GET /user` request shows how to use a service ticket. This request returns a list of APIC-EM users. The content of the list it returns is governed by the role of the caller. If the caller has an *admin* role, the response contains a list of *all users*. If the caller has an *observer* role, the response contains only the caller's user information.

The `GET /user` request does not require any arguments. Add an `X-Auth-Token` header to your `GET /user` request. The value of `X-Auth-Token` is the service ticket that your previous call to `POST /ticket` returned.

![Figure](assets/images/header.jpg)

Code: GET /user request

The `get_X_auth_token()` in `apicem.py` returns the value of the service ticket. The `get()` method also calls `get_X_auth_token()`. So the following script doesn't show any statements for obtaining the token. In fact you won't see it in following labs because `apicem.py` embeds it in all of the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE functions.


*  Source code file: `lab1-2-get-user.py`
*  To run the Python file, enter:
    * On Linux or macOS:  `python3 lab1-2-get-user.py`
    * On Windows: `py -3 lab1-2-get-user.py` or `python lab1-2-get-user.py`

</code></pre>
</details>


#### Output

The response body from the controller shows that the `devnetuser` username has the `ROLE_POLICY_ADMIN` security role.

```
Executing GET 'https://sandboxapicem.cisco.com/api/v1/user'

Get 'user' Status:  200

{
    "response": [
        {
            "authorization": [
                {
                    "role": "ROLE_POLICY_ADMIN",
                    "scope": "ALL"
                }
            ],
            "username": "devnetuser",
            "authSource": "internal"
        }
    ],
    "version": "1.0"
}

User 'devnetuser', role is the POLICY_ADMIN.
```

The following image shows which part of code produces which output. As you can see, there are two for-loop statements in the code. The outer loop iterates the content within "response":[....]. The inner loop iterates the content within "authorization":[.....].

## Session Summary
In this session, you learned:

* How to create a service ticket by calling `POST /ticket`.
* How to use the service ticket in a subsequent request by placing `{"X-Auth-Token": ticket}` in a header.
* How to put frequently used code in one file, `apicem.py`.
* How to `import apicem` and reuse its capabilities.

## Next step
* Proceed to Step 3: Use network device-related APIs.
