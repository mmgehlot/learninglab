# APIC-EM APIs with Python: Part 1 - The basics

## Objectives

* Understand the basics of the APIC-EM API calls.
* Learn how to write custom scripts in Python that make APIC-EM API calls.

## Prerequisites

* Familiarity with REST APIs and JSON.
* Basic proficiency with Python or a similar high-level programming language.

To study these topics, complete the [Intro to Coding and APIs Lab](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/lab/intro-coding-and-apis/step/1).

You will make API calls to an APIC-EM controller. By default, these labs use the [Cisco DevNet Sandbox’s](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/) APIC-EM controller at https://sandboxapicem.cisco.com/.


## Set up your computer

To set up your computer, complete the following steps. (If you are using Cisco-provided hardware or have already set up these items, skip to the next section.)

### Install Git
Download and install Git from [https://git-scm.com/downloads].

### Install Python 3.x
Download and install Python 3.x from [https://www.python.org/downloads/].

### Install the Requests Library
Download and install [Requests: HTTP for Humans](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) for your appropriate operating system. Installing this library allows you to make REST calls from within your Python scripts.

For macOS, use these commands:
```bash
sudo curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
sudo python3 get-pip.py
pip3 install requests
```

For Windows, complete these steps:
1. The pip package comes with Python 3.4 on Windows. Check to see if the pip package is in your Python 3 path by entering:
```
bash
C:\>pip –V
pip 1.5.6 from C:\Python34\lib\site-packages
```

If pip is in the Python34 path, enter:
```
bash
pip install requests
```

### Clone and configure the APIC-EM Git repo

If you are using Cisco-provided hardware at a Cisco event the following tasks have probably been completed:
* The lab sample code has been downloaded to `C:\apicem-apis-with-python-sample-codes\basic-labs`.
* The `APICEM_IP` parameter in the `apicem_config.py` configuration file is configured to use an APIC-EM controller that’s available for training purposes.

If so, you can probably skip to the next section.

Create a working directory. For example:
```bash
mkdir \workingdir\
```

Clone the APIC-EM sample code to your working directory. For example:
```bash
cd \workingdir\
git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/apicem-apis-with-python-sample-codes
```

After the `git clone` completes, you have the Python files used in the following labs.

By default, these files are configured to send API calls to the sandboxed Cisco APIC-EM controller, as shown here:
```
APICEM_IP = "sandboxapicem.cisco.com"
```

To use a different controller, locate the `apicem_config.py` configuration file. For example: `username/workingdir/apicem-apis-with-python-sample-codes/basic-labs/apicem_config.py`

Edit the `apicem_config.py` file and assign the URL or IP address of the APIC-EM controller you’ll be using to the `APICEM_IP` variable. If the controller is configured to listen on a specific port number, include the value of the port number in the URL or IP address.

## Step 1: Learn the basics of the APIC-EM REST API

### Overview

The APIC-EM Controller exposes a northbound REST API to the enterprise, WAN, and campus networks. Network Engineers and applications use this REST API to interact with the controller. The controller’s network programmability and network control help IT organizations respond to changing conditions.

The APIC-EM Controller has southbound interfaces to the network control plane. It uses these interfaces to manage and interact with other network devices. Thus, you can use the REST API to manage the controller and add dynamic software-defined networking (SDN) functionality to your applications.

### Run the scripts

To run the scripts in this lab:
* In a macOS or Linux terminal, enter `python3 scriptName`
* At Windows command prompt, enter `py –3 scriptName` or `python scriptName`

Alternatively, you can use the Python IDE, *IDLE*:
* In a macOS terminal, enter `idle3` to run IDLE for Python3.
* In Windows, use the **Start** menu to run IDLE.

### APIC-EM REST API URLs
The URL of an API endpoint on Cisco APIC-EM controller has the following parts:
```
https://fqdn-Or-IPofController/api/v1/api_itself
```

Where:
* `https://fqdn-Or-IPofController` is the *base URL*. If needed, the URL can include a port number.
* `api/v1/` is the version number of the NB REST API.
* `/api_itself` is the API endpoint.

### Issue HTTP requests from Python

The APIC-EM REST API uses the following standard HTTP "CRUD" methods to create, read, update, and delete:
* **POST** creates data.
* **GET** reads (retrieves) data.
* **PUT** updates data.
* **DELETE** deletes data.

**Note:** For security, APIC-EM API always formats POST and PUT request parameters and arguments as JSON-formatted key-value pairs inside the request payload.

The following code snippets show how to use the Python requests library to issue each of these HTTP requests.

#### GET

To get data, a Python script issues a GET request, such as:

```python
import requests
url = "https://fqdn-Or-IPofController/api/v1/api_itself"
response = requests.get(url,verify=False)
# verify=False means not verifying the SSL certificate
```

#### POST

To create data, a Python script issues a POST request, such as:

```python
import requests
import json

json_obj = {
"key":"value"
}
url = "https://fqdn-Or-IPofController/api/v1/api_itself"
# need to specify content type -json- for POST request #
headers = {'content-type': 'application/json'}
response = requests.post(url, json.dumps(json_obj), headers=headers,verify=False)
```

#### PUT

To modify data, a Python script issues a PUT request, such as:

```python
import requests
import json

json_obj = {
"key":"value_to_change"
}
url = "https://fqdn-Or-IPofController/api/v1/api_itself"
# need to specify content type -json- for PUT request #
headers = {'content-type': 'application/json'}
response = requests.put(url, json.dumps(json_obj), headers=headers,verify=False)
```

#### DELETE

To delete data, a Python request issues a DELETE request, such as:

```python
import requests
url = "https://fqdn-Or-IPofController/api/v1/api_itself"
response = requests.delete(url,verify=False)
```

### APIC-EM REST API Reference
For detailed information about the API, see
[Cisco APIC-EM API Reference Docs](https://developer.cisco.com/site/apic-em-rest-api/)

## Next steps
The following labs create simple Python applications that interact with the Cisco APIC-EM controller' API. Run the scripts in each lab session to see the live responses from APIC-EM controller.

* Step 2: Generate a new service ticket and get information of all APIC-EM users.
* Step 3: Use network device-related APIs.
