# Step 3: Use network device-related APIs

## Objectives

* Learn how to use the following network device-related APIs to retrieve network device information: `GET /network-device`, `GET /network-device/{networkDeviceId}/config` and  `GET /interface/network-device/{deviceId`.

* Learn how to create a list that contains network device information, how to display that list to the user, and how to interact with the user to accept input of values that appear in the list, while rejecting invalid values.

## Assignment of unique network IDs to network devices and device discovery

The Cisco APIC-EM controller assigns a unique ID to every network device. You can pass this ID to a variety of network device-related calls to retrieve information about a specific device, such as its IOS configuration and interfaces.

NOTE: The Cisco APIC-EM controller can scan for and discover physical devices attached to a network. To initiate this discovery process, you can send a `POST /discovery` call to the controller, or you can click the Discovery icon in its GUI. The Cisco APIC-EM controller in the Cisco DevNet Learning Labs is pre-populated with the results of a previous discovery, so this lab does not examine Discovery.

## Application that displays IOS configuration

In this section, you create a simple application to:
* Prompt the user to select a device.
* Display the IOS configuration of the user-selected device.

Pseudo-code:
1. Use `GET /network-device` to display a list of network devices with IP addresses.
2. Accept user input of device selection.
3. Use `GET /network-device/{deviceId}/config` to retrieve the IOS configuration of the specified device, then display the IOS configuration to the user.


### Task 1: Present a list of network devices with IP addresses

To display a list of network devices to the user, retrieve network device information by issuing the `GET /network-device` request. The response body returns a list of network devices. Each block in the response provides information about a single device, including its network device name, IP, type, network device ID and more.

This network device ID provides a way of identifying a specific network device to many APIs, including the `GET /network-device/{deviceId}/config` request.

The `GET /network-device` response block provides many attributes. Your application uses the following attributes:
* `instanceUuid` or `id` is the ID the controller assigned to the network device at discovery.
* `hostname` is the name of the network device. Note that this attribute applies to both hosts and devices.
* `managementIpAddress` is the IP address of the network device.
* `type` is the type of network device, such as a switch, router, or access point.

#### Code - `GET /network-device`, parse the response, and display the information

In this sample code, you use the `GET /network-device` API to retrieve detailed information about all network devices known to the controller. Then, you parse the response for the `hostname`, `managementIpAddress`, `type` and `id` attributes to create a list that contains these values. Use the Python `tabulate` module to present the list as a table.

For simplicity, the `tabulate.py` file has been placed in the sample code directory you cloned earlier.

*  Source code file: `lab2-1-get-network-device-list.py`
*  To run the Python file, enter one of the following:

   *  On Linux or macOS  `python3 lab2-1-get-network-device-list.py`
   *  On Windows: `py -3 lab2-1-get-network-device-list.py` or `python lab2-1-get-network-device-list.py`

#### The following figure shows how you parse the response from "GET /network-device":<br>

![Figure](assets/images/network_device.png)

#### Output: Device information in tabular format

![Figure](assets/images/tabulate.jpg)

Now you ask the user to select a device from the list. Then, your application will show the IOS configuration of the specified device.

### Task 2: Prompt the user for input and retrieve the device ID and get IOS configuration  
The following code from lab2-2-get-network-device-id-config.py prompts the user to select a device from the table. Then, it uses this input to retrieve the appropriate device ID from previously parsed device information.

```
id = ""
device_id_idx = 4
while True:
    user_input = input('=> Select one of the device numbers shown for the IOS config: ')
    user_input= user_input.replace(" ","") # ignore space
    if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
        sys.exit()
    if user_input.isdigit():
        if int(user_input) in range(1,len(device_list)+1):
            id = device_list[int(user_input)-1][device_id_idx]
            break
        else:
            print ("Oops! number is out of range. Please try again or enter 'exit'")
    else:
        print ("Oops! input is not a digit. Please try again or enter 'exit'")
# End of while loop
```


Later in the code it passes the network device ID obtained from the user input as the {id} value in the `GET /network-device/{id}/config` request. Additionally, it provides an example of some simple error-handling code.

## Task 3: Adding more functionality to the application
You learned how to retrieve the network device ID of a specific device and use it to retrieve the IOS configuration of the device. This network device ID can be used in other APIs, as well. For example, you can use it to get interface information from the `GET /interface/network-device/{id}` request.

#### Get interface information by device ID ####
To get a list of interfaces for a given device ID, you need to make a function call to `/interface/network-device/{id}`.
Please refer to [APIC-EM API Reference Docs](https://developer.cisco.com/site/apic-em-rest-api/) for more details.
With a minor modification to the last code listing, you can let the user choose whether to display IOS configuration or device interface information.<br>

**Pseudo-code:**

1. NEW: Ask the user whether to display IOS configuration or interface information; reject incorrect choices.
2. Create a network device list. This step is unchanged from the previous example.
3. Ask the user to select a network device from the list.
4. CHANGED: Call the API that reflects the user's choices in steps 1 and 3.

#### Code - GET '/network-device/{id}/config' and GET '/interface/network-device/{id}'

*  Source code file: lab2-3-get-network-device-id-config-interface.py
*  To run the Python file, enter one of the following:
   *  On Linux or macOS: `python3 lab2-3-get-network-device-id-config-interface.py`
   *  On Windows: `py -3 lab2-3-get-network-device-id-config-interface.py` or `python lab2-3-get-network-device-id-config-interface.py`

This output is the result of the following interactions between the application and the user:

*  The user selected "1" for interfaces list.
*  The application listed the network devices.
*  The user selected 7, the network device with IP = 212.1.10.1.
*  The application retrieved the network device ID with IP 212.1.10.1, applied the network device ID to "GET /interface/network-device/{id}", and displayed the interface list response data.


## Session summary

In this session, you learned:

* How to use the following network device-related APIs to retrieve network device information: `GET /network-device`, `GET /network-device/{networkDeviceId}/config` and  `GET /interface/network-device/{deviceId}`.
* How to create a list that contains network device information, how to display that list to the user, and how to interact with the user to accept input of values that appear in the list, while rejecting invalid values.

The network device ID is the key to many APIC-EM APIs. There are more APIs related to network device ID. With minor modifications, you can expand this application to be used for more APIs. Here are a few examples:

*  `GET /network-device/{id}/location` - Gets the location for the given device ID.
*  `GET /network-device/{id}` - Gets the network device for the given device ID.
*  `GET /license-info/network-device/{deviceId}` - Gets the list of licenses for network device with given device ID.
*  `DELETE /network-device/{id}` - Removes a specific network device from inventory.

### This concludes Part I of APIC-EM REST API Learning Labs.
